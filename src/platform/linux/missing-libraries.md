# Missing Libraries

If Anki fails to start, please run it from a terminal with `anki`. If it says a
library is missing, please install it and try again.

If it complains about no platform being available, please start Anki with the
following command line, which should reveal a missing library:

```shell
QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1 anki
```

After installing the library with apt-get or similar, repeat the process. You
may need to do this a few times before all required libraries are installed.
