# Windows installation issues

Some error messages you may encounter when installing Anki:

<!-- toc -->

Please also see [startup issues](./startup-issues.md).

## "Error opening file for writing"

If closing Anki and your browser does not help, please try restarting your
computer, then running the installer again.

## "Windows protected your PC"

When a new Anki version is released, Windows may display a scary-looking message
until it has seen enough people using the new version. To be able to proceed
with app installation, please use [Run anyway](https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/windows-protected-your-pc-disable-smartscreen/).

Antivirus programs may sometimes also report a [false positive](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/my-antivirus-program-says-anki-is-infected.html).
